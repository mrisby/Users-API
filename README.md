# Creating A RESTful API
## Users-API
### RESTful Design Principles
API's power nearly all modern day applications. Though end users don't interact with them directly, it is important to put effort into designing them so that they are efficient, flexible, and easy to use. When designing APIs, other developers become the users. The goal is to build APIs to assist other developers to create rich, fully-featured applications.

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing loosely coupled web services, or APIs. It defines a set of constraints that allow for interoperability between services through a uniform and predefined set of operations.
